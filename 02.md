# Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. 
* Boolean
* Char
* Numeric
* Array
  
## Scalar Types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

### Integer Types

**Integer Types in Rust**

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|----|---|-|
| 8-bit  | i8 | u8  |
| 16-bit | i16| u16 |
| 32-bit | i32| u32 |
| 64-bit | i64| u64 |
| arch   | isize| usize |

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table

**Integer Literals in Rust**
| Number literals | Example |
|----|---|-|
| Decimal  | 98_222 
| Hex      | 0xff| 
| Octal    | 0o77| 
| Binary   | 0b1111_0000| 
| Byte (u8 only)   | b'A'|

## Floating-Point Types
Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points.
Floating-point types are 
* f32
* f64
  ```rust
     let x = 2.0; // f64
     let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
  ```
  The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

## Numeric Operations
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,and remainder
```rust
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
```    

## The Boolean Type
Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false
```rust
let t = true;

let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation    
```

## Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: **tuples and arrays**
### The Tuple Type
A tuple is a general way of grouping together some number of other values with a variety of types into one compound type.
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```
To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```
In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

### The Array Type
Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Every element of an array must have the same type , 
In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```
### Accessing Array Elements
An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

# Functions
You’ve already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the main function, which is the entry point of many programs.
Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
Function definitions in Rust start with **fn** and have a set of parentheses after the function name

### Function Parameters
Functions can also be defined to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters.

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

### Functions with Return Values
Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (->).

In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. 
```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
