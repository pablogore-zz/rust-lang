# Control Flow
The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are if expressions and loops.

## if Expressions
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

## Using if in a let Statement
Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statemen
```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };
    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

The number variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the if expression.

# Repetition with Loops
It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task, Rust provides several loops.
Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while, and for. Let’s try each one.

## Repeating Code with loop
The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

When we run this program, we’ll see again! printed over and over continuously until we stop the program manually.

## Conditional Loops with while
It’s often useful for a program to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0  {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number = number - 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

## Looping Through a Collection with for
You could use the while construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}
```

As a more concise alternative, you can use a for loop and execute some code for each item in a collection. A for loop looks like the code.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```
