# The Big Ideas – Ownership and Borrowing


Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector

### Scope and ownership

In Rust, every data value has a single owning scope. So, what's a scope? The easy answer is that a scope is the place where a block expression stores its variables.

But a scope begins when a block expression begins, with a { symbol, and ends when the block expression ends, with } (or when a return statement is run before the block reaches its end). The scope is the chunk of memory where the block's variables are stored.

When Rust is done with a scope, all of the data values that scope owns are discarded and the memory that was used to store them is freed up for other uses.


## The Stack and the Heap
The stack and the heap are parts of memory that is available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways.

The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.
Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is called popping off the stack.

The stack is fast because of the way it accesses the data: it never has to search for a place to put new data or a place to get data from because that place is always the top. Another property that makes the stack fast is that all data on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.

Data with a size unknown at compile time or a size that might change can be stored on the heap instead. 
The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you ask for some amount of space. The operating system finds an empty spot somewhere in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This process is called allocating on the heap, sometimes abbreviated as just “allocating.” 
Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there.

## Ownership Rules
Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

* Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
* There can be only one owner at a time.
* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
  
## Variable Scope
Let’s say we have a variable that looks like this:
```rust
{                      // s is not valid here; it's not yet declared
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward
    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```
In other words, there are two important points in time here:
* When s comes into scope, it is valid.
* It remains valid until it goes out of scope.

## Memory and Allocation
With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

* The memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.
* We need a way of returning this memory to the operating system when we’re done with our String.

In Rust the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.
```rust
{
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward
    // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                   // longer valid
```

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called drop, and it’s where the author of String can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls drop automatically at the closing curly bracket.


```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
```
 A String is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the content.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1;
```
 When we assign s1 to s2, the String data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.
 ![](/images/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2018-12-20&#32;at&#32;12.08.12.png)

 Rust automatically calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable.

 This is a problem: when s2 and s1 go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a **double free error** and is one of the memory safety bugs 

 ## Ways That Variables and Data Interact: Clone
 If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called clone.

 ```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
 ```

## Ownership and Functions

The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does. 
```rust
n main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to
                                    // still use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved,
  // nothing special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

##  Borrowing
* Sometimes , a function doesn't need to own a value , For that , we have borrowing
* A value can be inmutability borrowed any number of times  

```rust
    // a owns the value
    let a = foo();
    //a still owns the value
    let b =&a;
    //but a function can still use it if they only need to borrow.
    do_somthing_yet_again(&a);
```
