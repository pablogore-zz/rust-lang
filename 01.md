# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.

## Variables & Mutability
By default variables are immutable , however, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.

**When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value.**

* Variables immutable by default
* The following code will not compile

```rust
 fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Unlike some languages, mostly purely functional ones, Rust actually does support mutable bindings.
```rust
    let mut counter=0;
    counter=counter +1;
    counter=counter + 10;
```

## Differences Between Variables and Constants

Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

First, you aren’t allowed to use mut with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

## Shadowing
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable

We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the let keyword as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between mut and shadowing is that we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```
