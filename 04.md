Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use them in a real program. You’ll learn about let, match, methods, associated functions, external crates,and more! 

# Setting Up a New Project
To set up a new project, go to the projects directory that you created in Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:
```bash
cargo new guessing_game --bin
```

The first command, cargo new, takes the name of the project (guessing_game) as the first argument. The --bin flag tells Cargo to make a binary project, like the one in Chapter 1. The second command changes to the new project’s directory.

Now let’s compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same step using the cargo run command:
```
$ cargo run
    Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs
    Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Hello, world!
```

# Processing a Guess

The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a **use** statement.

The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an associated function of the String type. An associated function is implemented on a type, in this case String, rather than on a particular instance of a String. Some languages call this a static method.
